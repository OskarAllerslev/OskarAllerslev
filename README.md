# üí´ About Me:
I am a highly motivated third-year Bachelor student at the University of Copenhagen, specializing in **Actuarial Mathematics**. With a strong foundation in advanced mathematics, statistics, and growing programming expertise, I‚Äôm excited about applying quantitative methods to solve complex financial and actuarial challenges. My interests in **quant finance**, **risk management**, and **algorithmic trading** drive me to continually expand my skills in **Python**, **R**, and **C++**.  
<br>

I am currently seeking **Summer 2025 Internship** opportunities to further hone my quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and time series forecasting skills in a dynamic, collaborative environment.
